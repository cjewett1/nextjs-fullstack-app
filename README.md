# Fullstack App using Next.js

## Overview
This site mimics a standard blog site, where the user can login with google, create a blog post and then other signed in users can then comment on other users posts. This site is styled and laid out using Tailwind, a CSS library that I quite enjoy using. It's fairly simple to use and I think its great for quickly making a visually pleasing site with lots of great functionality. This site was a code along so I can't claim it to be my own. This site was a fantastic learning tool.

This site uses firebase to send and fetch data from my firestore database, it also features firebase authentication to sign in with google. This site also uses an interesting library called Toastify which allowed me to customize validation, error and success messages. 

## Why did I make this project? Why did I use React and Next.js?
As mentioned about, it was a code along, and I used it to learn about using firebase and google to allow a user to sign in and create a blog and comment on another users blog page. This site also uses params to pass data between pages to keep a user logged in.

## Project Status
It is complete. A user can login, make a blogpost and comment on another users post. It also features the ability to edit and delete your posts.
